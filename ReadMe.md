Files Used
calendar.csv: Air BnB's Seattle data.

This is a project which looks at the availability of air b&b listings for Seattle across a 12 month period. it seeks to answer 3 main questions.
* What is the demand like and is there any seasonal variation to this across the year?
* What amount of money is lost for each listing ID across the year?
* Is it the price that is putting people off?

The analyses showed that there is greater availability of properties in the spring and just before new year (December time). The average potential earning is around 7500-10000 with the max showing at around 35000, and the minimum 5000. Finally there was a significant, positive corelation between the number of available properties and the price, suggesting that more expensive properties wer not booked as much. 

A full analysis of the data is conatined within the jupyter notebook in this repo and for a full discussion of the above questions please visit the blog post!
