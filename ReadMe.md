This is a project which looks at the availability of air b&b listings for Seattle across a 12 month period. it seeks to answer 3 main questions.
* What is the demand like and is there any seasonal variation to this across the year?
* What amount of money is lost for each listing ID across the year?
* Is it the price that is putting people off?

A full analysis of the data is conatined within the jupyter notebook in this repo and for a full discussion of the above questions please visit the blog post!
